The solution involves using promises to ensure the image URI is saved to AsyncStorage before it's deleted. Here's the corrected code:

```javascript
import * as React from 'react';
import { Camera, useCameraDevices } from 'expo-camera';
import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';

// ... other components

async function takePicture(cameraRef) {
  if (cameraRef) {
    try {
      let photo = await cameraRef.takePictureAsync();
      const saveResult = await AsyncStorage.setItem('imageUri', photo.uri);
      console.log('Image URI saved successfully:', saveResult);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error taking picture or saving URI:', error);
    }
  }
}

// ... rest of the component
```
This revised code prevents the race condition by waiting for the AsyncStorage operation to complete before proceeding, thereby guaranteeing the image URI is safely stored.
