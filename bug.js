This bug occurs when using the Expo SDK's `Camera` component in conjunction with the `AsyncStorage` API.  The problem arises when taking a picture and then trying to store the image URI in `AsyncStorage`.  The app may crash or experience unexpected behavior, especially when handling a large number of images or when the app is running low on memory. This is because the URI might point to a temporary file that's deleted before the `AsyncStorage` operation completes. The race condition between the camera's URI and AsyncStorage's write operation causes unpredictable errors.
